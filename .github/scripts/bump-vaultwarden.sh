# Bring the add-on version in line with the pinned Vaultwarden release.
#
# Usage: .github/scripts/bump-vaultwarden.sh [vaultwarden-version]
#
# With a version argument the Dockerfile pin is rewritten first; without one
# the pin is taken as-is. That second form is what runs after Renovate has
# already bumped the pin on main — Renovate rewrites the Dockerfile and
# nothing else, so the add-on version, changelog and README still have to
# catch up or Home Assistant never sees a new release.
#
# Rewrites, in place:
#   vaultwarden/Dockerfile    only when a version argument is given
#   vaultwarden/config.yaml   the add-on version Home Assistant sees
#   vaultwarden/CHANGELOG.md  a new entry on top
#   README.md                 the version this fork advertises
#
# The add-on version follows the shape of the Vaultwarden bump: a new minor
# bumps the add-on minor, a new patch bumps the add-on patch.
#
# In GitHub Actions the result is written to $GITHUB_OUTPUT as `changed`
# (true/false), `shipped`, `version` and `addon_version`.
